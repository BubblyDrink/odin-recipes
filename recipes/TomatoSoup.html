        <h1><strong>Kentucky Tomato Soup</strong></h1>
        <p><h2>This creamy tomato soup is delicious and has a twist - the addition of strong, black coffee. This is the perfect summer dish for using freshly picked tomatoes from the garden. Remember - the better the quality of the tomatoes, the better the taste of the soup.</h2></p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p><h4><ul>
            <li> 3 tablespoons of butter</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped onions</li>
            <li>2 stalks celery chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leafed parsley</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups chopped fresh tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>3/4 cup strong brewed coffee</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/3 cup heavy cream</li>
        
        </ul></h4></p>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <p><h4><ol>
            <li>Melt the butter in a stock pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion, carrots, celery, garlic, and parsley; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, tomato sauce, coffee, water, sugar, salt, and pepper. Bring the soup to a boil and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour the hot soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Stir in the cream and heat until warm. Do not boil.</li>

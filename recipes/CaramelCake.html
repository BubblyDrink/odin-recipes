        <h1><strong>Caramel Apple Dump Cake</strong></h1>
        <p><h2>Warm, spicy apples with a buttery, crunchy topping. This screams fall! This is so easy and quick and sure to be a crowd pleaser. This would be delicious with vanilla ice cream and maybe top with more of the caramel sauce.</h2></p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p><h4><ul>
            <li>Cooking spray</li>
            <li>2 (21 ounce) cans apple pie filling</li>
            <li>1/2 cup caramel sauce</li>
            <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package spice cake mix</li>
            <li>1 cup salted butter, melted</li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cake is golden brown and the filling is bubbling through to the top, 50 to 55 minutes. Let cool at least 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
